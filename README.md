# Josephus


This is an example of the Josephus problem.
It will run to show the order in which the 'players' of the game will be eliminated.

To run the program, you will need to download the git repository and unzip it, or else clone it to your computer.

The function called 'josephus' will give you the order of people that would be eliminated according to the rules of the Josephus permutation.

The function takes two parameters.  The first is the array of numbers (items) to be eliminated using the pattern.
The second parameter is the number of 'skips' that the function takes to decide which in the array will be eliminated.
